Hello Everyone! I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve completed my first PowerBI dashboard! It analyzes

sales and inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys. The data

includes information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each

location. I extracted the data from the MEXICO TOY SALES dataset on the Maven Analytics Website.

Check it out!

**Dataset:** The dataset includes CSV files for inventory, products, sales, and stores.

**Objective:** The objective of this analysis and dashboard is to provide insights into sales trends,

profit drivers, seasonal patterns, total sales and units, out-of-stock product impact, and inventory

levels to maximize profit and meet demand.

**Steps Involved:** The steps involved are requirement gathering, data cleaning, data

transformation using DAX functions to create measures such as profit, total sales, and inventory

value, creating visualizations using various charts such as bar charts for profit by category,

matrix charts for profit by product category across store locations, line charts for total sales by

month for time series analysis, and slicers to filter by year.

**KPIs Involved:** The KPIs involved are total sales and units sold. 

**Conclusion:** The PowerBI dashboard provided a top-level overview of the MEXICO Toy Sales business,

including sales and other metrics. This data can be used to make informed decisions such as stocking

items at specific locations, allocating marketing budgets for low-selling items, and offering discounts to

increase profits.
